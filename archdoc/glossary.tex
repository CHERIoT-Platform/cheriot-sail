{
  A capability contains an \gls{address}, \gls{capability bounds}
  describing a range of bytes within which addresses may be
  \glslink{dereference}{dereferenced}, \gls{capability permissions}
  controlling the forms of dereference that may be permitted (e.g., load or
  store), a \gls{capability tag} protecting \gls{capability validity}
  (integrity and \gls{capability provenance}), and a \gls{capability object type}
  indicating whether it is a \gls{sealed capability}
  (and, if so, under which \gls{capability object type} they are sealed)
  or \gls{unsealed capability}.
  The address embedded within a capability may be a \gls{virtual address} or
  a \glspl{physical address} depending on the current addressing mode; when
  used to authorize (un)sealing, the address is instead a
  \gls{capability object type}.

  In CHERI, capabilities are used to implement \glspl{pointer} with additional
  protections in aid of \gls{fine-grained memory protection},
  \gls{control-flow robustness}, and other higher-level protection models such
  as \gls{software compartmentalization}.
  Unlike a \gls{fat pointer}, capabilities are subject to
  \gls{capability provenance}, ensuring that they are derived from a prior
  valid capability only via valid manipulations, and \gls{capability
  monotonicity}, which ensures that manipulation can lead only to
  non-increasing rights.
  CHERI capabilities provide strong compatibility with C-language pointers and
  Memory Management Unit (MMU)-based system-software designs, by virtue of
  its \gls{hybrid capability model}.

  Architecturally, a capability can be viewed as an \gls{address} equal to the
  sum of the \gls{capability base} and \gls{capability offset}, as well as
  associated metadata.
%\psnote{Perhaps this base/offset view should now be de-emphasised?  It's
%arguably  implementation detail in any case}
  Dereferencing a capability is done relative to that address.
%  The implementation may choose to store the pre-computed address
%  combining the base and offset, to avoid an implied addition on each memory
%  access, and to similarly store the base and length as pre-computed
%  addresses.
  The size of an in-memory capability may be smaller than the sum of its
  architectural fields (such as base, offset, and permissions) if a
  \gls{compressed capability} mechanism, such as \gls{CHERI Concentrate}, is
  used.

  In the ISA, capabilities may be used explicitly via \gls{capability-based
  instructions}, an application of the \gls{principle of intentional use},
  but also implicitly using \glslink{legacy instructions}{legacy load
  and store instructions} via the \gls{default data capability}, and
  instruction fetch via the \gls{program-counter capability}.
  A capability is either sealed or unsealed, controlling whether it has
  software-defined or instruction-set-defined behavior, and whether or not its
  fields are immutable.

  Capabilities may be held in a \gls{capability register} in a dedicated
  \gls{capability register file}, a \gls{merged register file}, or a
  suitably aligned \gls{tagged memory}.

    exception makes a capability reachable that might not have been
    reachable before (namely the KCC) and the CCall instruction
    unseals capabilities without needing a capability that has the
    authority to unseal them. Perhaps it would be worth creating a
